==>For the User model Schema, 
we declare a name, a username.An e-mail, a password, a profile picture, a location, date of birth, following array, followers, array, tweets and lastly at timestamps 
===>and now for the tweets Schema.
 we declare content tweeted by array, likes array, retweet array, image array, reply array and lastly at timestamps.
And after the model we declare APIs 
 ===>for User . 
We made API for  registering the user.

 We made API for unfollowing the user.
 We made API for editing the user.
We made API for get all the tweets by the user. 
We made API for updating profile picture.
===>Now for the tweet
.We made API for creating the tweet.
 We made API for liking the tweet.
 We made API for disliking the tweet.
 We made API for reply that tweet.
